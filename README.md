### DESCRIPTION

ccva is software that came to my mind watching mr robot series. It allows you to hide more files into another one (.mp3 , .jpg, .pdf, .exe tested) with the possibility of crypt it.
From the original ccva we added:
* More Encrypting Methods
* Automated the encrypt and decrypt system using WinRar
* Design Patterns: Strategy and MVP
* WPF User Interface
